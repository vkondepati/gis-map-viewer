# Archived Unused Assets

This directory stores files that were removed from the active project surface because they are not required for runtime behavior or day-to-day contribution workflows.

## Archived content

- `extracted/`: generated snippet exports from documentation extraction workflows.
- `GIS_MAP_VIEWER.md`: original monolithic documentation source.
- `FILE_TREE.md`, `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`: generated/summary markdown files superseded by `README.md` and `docs/*`.

These files are retained for historical reference and can be restored if needed.
