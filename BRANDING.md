# NexaMap Branding

This document contains logo concepts, color palettes, typography, and usage guidance for the NexaMap project.

## Logo Concepts

1. Icon + Wordmark
   - A compact geometric icon representing a stylized map pin merged with an "N". Use alongside the full `NexaMap` wordmark for headers and marketing.

2. Wordmark Only
   - Clean sans-serif wordmark spelling `NexaMap` with a distinctive ligature on the "N" or stylized "x" to create brand recognition.

3. Monochrome Mark
   - Single-color silhouette of the icon for favicons, app launcher, and one-color prints.

4. Minimal Favicon
   - Square or rounded glyph (icon only) for browser tabs and mobile icons.

## Usage Guidelines

- Clear space: keep a margin equal to the height of the letter "x" in the wordmark around the logo.
- Minimum sizes: Wordmark should not appear smaller than 120px width for legibility; icon-only 24px.
- Do not stretch or distort; use provided SVGs.

If you want, I can: generate PNG exports, provide high-contrast variants, or produce a Figma/Sketch starter file.
